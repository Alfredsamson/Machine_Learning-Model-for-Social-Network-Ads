# Machine_Learning-Model-for-Social-Network-Ads
Social Media Network Ads is a Python project that uses machine learning to analyze and optimize online advertising campaigns on various social media platforms
# Useage

To use Social Media Network Ads, you need to provide a CSV file with the following columns:

User ID: A unique identifier for each user who saw the ad.

Gender: The gender of the user, either Male or Female.

The CSV file  named Social_Network_Ads.csv is  placed in the same directory as the main script.

To run the main script, use the following command:

Social Network Ads.py
The script will perform the following tasks:

Apply feature scaling to the Age, EstimatedSalary, Male columns.

Split the data into training and test sets.



Train the two  models on the training set.

Plot the confusion matrix
